# If Statements & While Loops

# We can use 'if' statements to execute code if a given condition is met.
# To check if two variables are the same we use DOUBLE equals (==)
# Python is case sensitive.  'Hello' is not the same as 'hello'.
# We can get around this by using .lower()Â 
# While loops are useful when we want the program to loop until a given condition is met but we don't know 
# how many times it needs to loop.

# If Statements!
#create a variable to loop my code
keep_going = ""
#while variable is empty keep looping
while keep_going == "":
  ##create a variable to store input from user about their coffee
  like_coffee = input("Do you like coffee? ").lower()
  
  if like_coffee == "yes" or like_coffee == "y":
    print("I like coffee too!")
  elif like_coffee == "no" or like_coffee == "n":
    print("You are missing out!")
  else:
    print("I don't understand!")
    
  keep_going = input ("Press <enter> to continue or any key to quit")
  print()
